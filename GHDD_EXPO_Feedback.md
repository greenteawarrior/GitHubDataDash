### Ask us about...
* Computing and Student-NINJA Feedback @ Olin!
* Data Dashboard Design
* GitHub @ Olin

### Tweetable stories
* @greenteawarrior and @RyanCLouie built a GitHub Data Dashboard for Olin alum @mr_ritter's Data Dashboard Design seminar!
* We made a dashboard for student-NINJA feedback on GitHub @OlinCollege! @RyanCLouie (project for @mr_ritter's alumni seminar on Data Dashboard Design)

### Notes:
* People curious if this hooks up into a larger system at Olin
* Mel wants us to share the implementation with her (code handoff)
* Consider the progress bars -- based on students, rather than NINJAs
* Maybe some NINJAs have more bandwidth than others and can share the workload
* What is the counter based off of? If Chris takes some repos for Sawyer, does that count more towards Chis or Sawyer?
* When is the counter reset?
* Maybe the # of students helped is not the best metric. Maybe 5 students who need a lot of attention is way more work than 15 students who don't need a lot of extra help.
* Make it customizable per professor
* Quality of feedback?
* Word cloud idea
