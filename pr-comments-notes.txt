pull_request["url"].split('/')
issue_comment["url"].split('/')

# time of comment
review_comment["updated_at"]
issue_comment["updated_at"]
pull_request["updated_at"]

# who made the comment
issue_comment["user"]["login"]
review_comment["user"]["login"]
pull_request["user"]["login"]

# how many
len(pr-list)

# how many new comments in the given interval
its a sql query that selects the comments where updated_at is (24 hours?) recent

# links to the comments
review_comment["html_url"]
issue_comment["html_url"]
pull_request["html_url"]

# comment body in case we want to parse for useful tags, shenanigans
